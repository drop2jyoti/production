    "**Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Dask can calculate the moving average returns and there is no real need to convert the data frame to pandas in our case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Both Pandas DataFrames and Dask DataFrames have their strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different scenarios. In our scenario we are dealing with relatively small datasets, converting to Pandas is not a bad idea. Pandas library has a ease to use and rich functionalitu that is used in data analysis and visualization. It comes with benefit of in-memory processing which leads to fast execution for our datasets that fit within available memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we are working with big data and which requires efficient parallel or distributed computing, Dask DataFrames offer an impressive solution. Our choice ultimately depends on the size of our data, the complexity of our tasks, and most important willingness to explore and adopt new tools for optimal performance and scalability."
